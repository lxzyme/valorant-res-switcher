# valorant-res-switcher

fast res switching for valorant. made this because going through nvidia control panel every time is annoying.

## how to use

download the ps1 file and run it. press Q/W/E/R for quick switching or use the menu.

- Q = 1920x1080 
- W = 1440x1080 (most popular)
- E = 1600x1080 
- R = 1280x1080

works with any gpu. uses windows api not driver stuff.

## install

just download ValorantResSwitcher.ps1 and run it. might need to run as admin.

if windows blocks it:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## why

switching stretched res in valorant sucks when you have to go through control panels. this stays open so you can switch fast between games.

tested on windows 10/11 with nvidia and amd cards.
